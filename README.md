# Stock Price and SP 500 Prediction after COVID-19

This project explores the application of machine learning models to predict stock price movements. By leveraging financial indicators and historical stock price data, the goal is to train models capable of predicting the direction of stock price changes.

Note: This project is for educational purposes only and should not be interpreted as investment advice. The models demonstrated here are purely experimental and their performance in this context may not reflect real-world trading scenarios.

## Data Collection

The historical S&P 500 index data used in this project is sourced from Kaggle's S&P 500 dataset. The address is https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/sp-500-stocks. For convenience, the data is also available for download on my personal website. The dataset covers the period up to September 9, 2024.

## Models Used

The following models have been implemented in this project:

ARIMA: Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average

SARIMA: Seasonal ARIMA

Prophet: Facebook's Prophet for time series forecasting

XGBoost: Extreme Gradient Boosting

GAN: Generative Adversarial Networks

NN: Neural Networks

LSTM: Long Short-Term Memory Networks

GRU: Gated Recurrent Units

Seq2Seq: Sequence-to-Sequence models

Transformer: Transformer-based models

TCN: Temporal Convolutional Networks

DeepAR: Deep Autoregressive Models

## Ongoing Updates

The results will be updated monthly. Additionally, I plan to include more state-of-the-art (SOTA) time series models, especially those developed after the COVID-19 pandemic, to further enhance prediction accuracy.

## Results

Detailed results and performance metrics will be shared and updated regularly to reflect the progress of this project.
